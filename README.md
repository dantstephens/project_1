Global Billionaire Analysis:
The goal of this project is to find trends among billionaires across the globe to find if there is any correlation between items in the Billionaire Statistics dataset (billionaires-statistics-dataset) and the Billionaires Listed in Forbes dataset (billionaires-listed-in-forbes). Our primary inquiries surround, gender, educational rates, citizenship, residency, country of employment, industry in which they work, self made status, and the country of residency’s GDP.

Research Questions:
- What is the ratio of billionaires with higher educational degrees versus those with high school degrees or drop outs?
- How does the source of the billionaires’ income affect their educational level?
- How do the differences in education amongst the billionaires affect their net worth?
- Which country is producing the most billionaires?
- Which country has the most billionaires per population?
- In this country, which industry is most popular amongst billionaires?
- Which industry is producing the most billionaires across the globe?
- How do ‘self made’ billionaires compare to those who work in other industries.
- What is the ratio between male to female billionaires?
- Which country has the highest gender gap amongst billionaires? Which has the lowest?
