Global Billionaire Analysis:
The goal of this project is to find trends among billionaires across the globe to find if there is any correlation between items in the Billionaire Statistics dataset (billionaires-statistics-dataset) and the Billionaires Listed in Forbes dataset (billionaires-listed-in-forbes). Our primary inquiries surround, gender, educational rates, citizenship, residency, country of employment, industry in which they work, self made status, and the country of residency’s GDP.

Research Questions:
- What is the ratio of billionaires with a 'University/College' level education versus those with 'High School' level education, 'Drop Out's,' or 'Others'?
- How does the source of the billionaires’ income affect their educational level?
- How do the differences in education amongst the billionaires affect their net worth?
- Which country is producing the most billionaires?
- Which country has the most billionaires per population?
- In this country, which industry is most popular amongst billionaires?
- Which industry is producing the most billionaires across the globe?
- How do ‘self made’ billionaires compare to those who work in other industries.
- What is the ratio between male to female billionaires?
- Which country has the highest gender gap amongst billionaires? Which has the lowest?


Male VS Female Analysis of Billionaires:
Overall the mean worth of Male to Female billionaires is comparable even with only 12% of global billionaires being female. The top 3 industries producing male billionaires are Finance & Investments, Technology, and Manufacturing. The top 3 industries producing female billionaires are Food & Beverage, Manufacturing, and Fashion & Beauty. The only industry with Male only billionaires is Telecom. Finally, in the United States, California is the home to the most billionaires both male and female followed closely by New York in second.
